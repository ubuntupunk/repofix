### Changes Made

1. **Issue 1: Scan Progress Bar and Exit**:
   - Wrapped file scanning in try-catch to handle errors (e.g., invalid patterns).
   - Ensured `logBox` and `progressBar` are checked before rendering.
   - Added console logs for debugging when `logBox` is null.
   - Kept `dirScreen` alive until scanning completes, only destroying it after `scanAndReport`.

2. **Issue 2: Special Case Navigation and Saving**:
   - Added `mouse: true` and `autoSelect: true` to `actionList` for responsive navigation.
   - Initialized `specialCases: {}` in `initialConfig`.
   - Saved `CONFIG_PATH` immediately after adding a special case.
   - Used `form.submit()` to handle Enter cleanly, with feedback in `specialStatus`.

3. **Issue 3: Community Solutions Double Enter and Saving**:
   - Similar to issue 2, used `form.submit()` for single Enter submission.
   - Saved `CONFIG_PATH` after adding a special case.
   - Ensured `actionList` and `valueInput` focus correctly with `inputOnFocus: true`.

4. **Issue 5: Fix
