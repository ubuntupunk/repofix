# Monocheck Improvement Suggestions

This document outlines potential areas for improvement in the `monocheck` tool, with a focus on the TUI's logging and progress reporting mechanisms.

## TUI LogBox and ProgressBar (`scanAndReport`)

The current implementation of logging and progress updates within the `scanAndReport` function, particularly when called from the TUI, has potential areas for optimization and usability enhancements.

**Current Issues/Observations:**

1.  **Excessive Rendering:** The `logBox?.screen.render()` call happens inside the loop for *every file processed*, both after logging the "Processing..." message and after updating the progress bar. This can lead to significant performance overhead and potential terminal flickering in projects with many files.
2.  **Log Verbosity:** Logging every single file being processed (`Processing: ...`) can overwhelm the log box, making it harder to spot important messages like errors or summaries.
3.  **Error Prominence:** While errors are colored red, they might be scrolled off quickly or lost in the noise of the per-file processing logs.

**Suggestions:**

1.  **Optimize Rendering:**
    *   **Reduce Render Frequency:** Remove the `logBox?.screen.render()` calls from *inside* the file processing loop. Instead, call `screen.render()` less frequently.
    *   **Batched Updates:** Consider updating the progress bar and rendering the screen only periodically (e.g., every 50 files, or every 500ms) instead of on every single file. This significantly reduces the rendering load.
    *   **Example (Conceptual):**
        ```typescript
        let filesProcessedSinceLastRender = 0;
        const RENDER_THRESHOLD = 50; // Render every 50 files

        for (const file of files) {
            // ... process file ...
            processedFiles++;
            filesProcessedSinceLastRender++;

            if (progressBar && totalFiles > 0 && logBox && filesProcessedSinceLastRender >= RENDER_THRESHOLD) {
                progressBar.setProgress((processedFiles / totalFiles) * 100);
                // Maybe log a batch progress message instead of per-file
                // logBox.log(`Processed ${processedFiles}/${totalFiles} files...`);
                logBox.screen.render(); // Render only periodically
                filesProcessedSinceLastRender = 0;
            }
        }
        // Ensure final progress is rendered
        if (progressBar && logBox) {
             progressBar.setProgress(100);
             logBox.screen.render();
        }
        ```

2.  **Improve Log Clarity:**
    *   **Reduce Verbosity:** Consider removing the per-file `Processing: ...` log message by default, or make it optional via a flag (e.g., `--verbose-scan`). Focus the log on directory starts, summaries, warnings, and errors.
    *   **Highlight Errors:** Make errors stand out more, perhaps using bold red (`kleur.bold().red()`) or adding a specific prefix like `[ERROR]`.
    *   **Structured Logging:** Use consistent prefixes for different message types (e.g., `[INFO]`, `[WARN]`, `[ERROR]`, `[SUMMARY]`).

3.  **Refine Progress Reporting:**
    *   If reducing render frequency, ensure the progress bar still gives a reasonable sense of progress. Updating it alongside the batched render calls (as in the example above) should be sufficient.
    *   Ensure the progress bar reliably reaches 100% upon completion, even if the number of files is small or doesn't align perfectly with the batching threshold.

## General Suggestions

1.  **Error Handling:** Ensure that errors during file processing (e.g., within the `try...catch` block in `scanAndReport`) don't necessarily stop the entire scan for a directory but are clearly logged. Consider adding a final summary count of errors per directory.
2.  **Code Structure:** The `scanAndReport` function handles both the core logic and TUI updates (via `logBox` and `progressBar`). Consider further decoupling by having `scanAndReport` emit events (e.g., `fileProcessed`, `errorOccurred`, `directoryComplete`) and letting the TUI components subscribe to these events to update themselves. This improves separation of concerns.
3.  **Alias Editing in TUI:** The "Edit config" -> "Aliases" option currently logs a message that it's not implemented. Implementing a TUI for editing aliases would enhance usability.
4.  **Dependency Management:** The suggestion `Run: npm/pnpm/bun add ${rootPkg}` is helpful. Since the user instructions specify `bun`, consistently suggest `bun add ${rootPkg}`.
5.  **Configuration Loading:** The main menu loads the config initially. If the config is edited externally (via the "Edit in editor" option), ensure the `initialConfig` variable is reliably updated upon returning to the TUI. The current implementation seems to handle this by re-reading after `spawnSync`, which is good.
6.  **`helpers.ts`:** Add JSDoc comments to the exported functions in `helpers.ts` to improve maintainability and understanding.
7.  **Type Safety:** The casting `as blessed.Widgets.ProgressBarElement` and `as BlessedListWithItems` might indicate areas where more specific types or type guards could be beneficial. The `BlessedListWithItems` interface is a good step in this direction.

Implementing some of these suggestions, particularly the rendering optimizations and log clarity improvements, could significantly enhance the user experience when scanning larger projects.
